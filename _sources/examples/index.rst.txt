Examples Gallery
================

The examples gallery is a collection of working code samples
demonstrating simple analysis and visualization using the CALM-Brain
resource. The examples lack a narrative explanation but are
well-commented with appropriate variable names to make the it
self-explanatory. In case you haven't already, please checkout
:doc:`../user-guide`. These examples are a way to get familiar with
using `almirah`_ and the CALM-Brain resource. The sole purpose of
these tutorials is to acquaint the user with the components of the
resource and not provide data related insights.
